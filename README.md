# G5 Authenticatable

G5 Authenticatable provides a default authentication solution for G5
Rails applications. This gem configures and mounts 
[Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) with a default User
model, using [OmniAuth](https://github.com/intridea/omniauth) to authenticate
to the G5 Auth server.

If you are already using devise with your own model, this is not the
library you are looking for. Consider using the
[devise_g5_authenticatable](https://github.com/g5search/devise_g5_authenticatable)
extension directly instead.

## Current Version

0.0.2

## Requirements

* [rails](https://github.com/rails/rails) >= 3.2

## Installation

1. Set the environment variable `DEVISE_SECRET_KEY` to the value
   generated by:

   ```console
   rake secret
   ```

2. Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

   ```ruby
   gem 'g5_authenticatable'
   ```

3. And then execute:

   ```console
   bundle
   ```

4. Run the generator:

   ```console
   rails g g5_authenticatable:install
   ```

   This creates a migration for the new g5_authenticatable_users
   table, and mounts the engine at `/g5_auth`.

5. Update your database:

   ```console
   rake db:migrate db:test:prepare
   ```

## Configuration

### Root route

Devise requires you to define a root route in your application's
`config/routes.rb`. For example:

```ruby
root :to => 'home#index'
```

### Registering your OAuth application

1. Visit the auth server admin console:
  * For development, visit https://dev-auth.g5search.com/admin
  * For production, visit https://auth.g5search.com/admin
2. Login as the default G5 admin (for credentials, see
   Brian Ricker or Chris Kraybill).
3. Click "New Application"
4. Enter a name that recognizably identifies your application.
5. Enter the redirect URI where the auth server should redirect
   after the user successfully authenticates. It will be
   of the form `http://<your_host>/g5_auth/users/auth/g5/callback`.

   For non-production environments, this redirect URI does not have to
   be publicly accessible, but it must be accessible from the browser
   where you will be testing (so using something like
   http://localhost:3000/users/auth/g5/callback is fine if your browser
   and client application server are both local).

   If you are using the production G5 Auth server, the redirect URI **MUST**
   use HTTPS.
6. For a trusted G5 application, check the "Auto-authorize?" checkbox. This
   skips the OAuth authorization step where the user is prompted to explicitly
   authorize the client application to access the user's data.
7. Click "Submit" to obtain the client application's credentials.

### Environment variables

Once you have your OAuth 2.0 credentials, you'll need to set the following
environment variables for your client application:

* `G5_AUTH_CLIENT_ID` - the OAuth 2.0 application ID from the auth server
* `G5_AUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` - the OAuth 2.0 application secret from the auth server
* `G5_AUTH_REDIRECT_URI` - the OAuth 2.0 redirect URI registered with the auth server
* `G5_AUTH_ENDPOINT` - the endpoint URL for the G5 auth server

## Usage

### Controller filters and helpers

G5 Authenticatable installs all of the usual devise controllers and helpers.
To set up a controller that requires authentication, use this before_filter:

```ruby
before_filter :authenticate_user!
```

To verify if a user is signed in, use the following helper:

```ruby
user_signed_in?
```

To access the model instance for the currently signed-in user:

```ruby
current_user
```

To access scoped session storage:

```ruby
user_session
```

### Route helpers

There are several generic helper methods for session and omniauth
URLs. To sign in:

```ruby
new_session_path(:user)
```

To sign out:

```ruby
destroy_session_path(:user)
```

There are also generic helpers for the OmniAuth paths, though you
are unlikely to ever use these directly. The OmniAuth entry point
is mounted at:

```ruby
g5_authorize_path(:user)
```

And the OmniAuth callback is:

```ruby
g5_callback_path(:user)
```

You may be more familiar with Devise's generated scoped URL helpers.
These are still available, but are isolated to the engine's namespace.
For example:

```ruby
g5_authenticatable.new_user_session_path
g5_authenticatable.destroy_user_session_path
```

### Test Helpers ###

When creating feature specs using RSpec, a user is available via let(:user).
All requests within the context are authenticated as that user.

```ruby
require 'authenticatable_test_helpers'

context 'my context', :auth do

  it 'can access some resource' do
    visit('the place')
    expect(page).to ...
  end

end
```

### Access token

When a user authenticates, their OAuth access token will be stored on
the local user:

```ruby
current_user.g5_access_token
```

This is to support server-to-server API calls with G5 services that are
protected by OAuth.

## Examples

### Protecting a particular controller action

You can use all of the usual options to `before_filter` for more fine-grained
control over where authentication is required. For example, to require
authentication only to edit a resource while leaving all other actions
unsecured:

```ruby
class MyResourcesController < ApplicationController
  before_filter :authenticate_user!, only: [:edit, :update]

  # ...
end
```

### Adding a link to sign in

In your view template, add the following:

```html+erb
<%= link_to('Login', new_session_path(:user)) %>
```

### Adding a link to sign out

In order to sign out, the link must not only have the correct path,
but must also use the DELETE HTTP method:

```html+erb
<%= link_to('Logout', destroy_session_path(:user), :method => :delete) %>
```

### Specs

Before running the specs for the first time, you will need to initialize the
database for the test Rails application.

```console
$ cp spec/dummy/config/database.yml.sample spec/dummy/config/database.yml
$ RAILS_ENV=test bundle exec rake app:db:setup
```

To execute the entire test suite:

```console
$ bundle exec rspec spec
```
